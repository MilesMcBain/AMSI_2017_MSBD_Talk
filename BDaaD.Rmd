#Baggage

##Big Hangover
> The Big Challenge in Big Data right now is managing Big Expectations
>
> -Me

+ The field is young. Your potential clients are likely still in the R&D phase of big data capacilities. Exciting!
- There is uncertainty about what is possible and what is needed.
- Much of the data available is being repurposed. It was never intended to be analysed all at once. **Lots** of noise. **Lots** of data collection and tidying!
- Success involves culture change.

##Navigating your First Big Data Project
* Be consultative
* Get feedback often
* Be ready for change
* Multiply the time you think data prep will take by 2-4x

Sound familiar to anyone?

#In Practice

## Big Data Enivornment
> Big Data lives in The Cloud. The Cloud lives on Commodity Hardware. Commodity Hardware runs Linux. Linux is Open Source. Open Source tools process Big Data.

* Work with Big Data in its home environment. Learn to love this technology stack.

## Get into the Cloud
Cloud computing providers:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Compute Engine, Digital Ocean, Microsoft Azure.

[AWS Demo](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)

Links:

* [Setting up RStudio in the Cloud](http://strimas.com/r/rstudio-cloud-1/)
* [RStudio Amazon Image](http://www.louisaslett.com/RStudio_AMI/)
* [Rocker](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker)

## Get into Linux
* **It is a software developer's paradise.**
* Not essential, but command line skills are very useful.
* If you really want to learn make it your everyday OS for a semester.
    - You can dual boot a laptop easily.
* Great places to start:
    [Ubuntu MATE](https://ubuntu-mate.org/about/)
    [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/about.php)
  
## Speak the language(s) | And Speak Them Well
Pursue opportunities to learn:

* 1 Open Source Scripting language: Julia, Python, **R**
* 1 SQL Variant: Microsoft SQL, **Postgresql**
* 1 JVM language: Java, Clojure, **Scala**
* 1 low level performant language: Fortran, x86 Assembly, **C++**

## Acquire the Big Data dialect
* The elementry data types of Big Data programming are List/Column/Vector and Dataframe/Table/Matrix.
* To lists you `map`, `apply`, `filter`
* To tables you `select`, `join`, `pivot`, `transpose`, `gather`, `spread`

Acquire this mental model. *R* is a great choice to learn this. So is *SQL*.

## Build A Modelling Toolkit
[Video Anthony Goldbloom on Winning Kaggle Competitions](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/useR-international-R-User-conference/useR2016/R-in-machine-learning-competitions):

* XGBoost (Boosted trees) and Convolutional Neural Networks dominate Kaggle.
* HOWEVER: [Sage advice from Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/jennybryan/status/782326492449480704)
* Linear models fit fast, scale well, and are easy to interpret.
* Kmeans is easy to understand and has 1 tuning parameter.
    - Compliment with something you can understand e.g. CART, Random Forest. 
    - Build out your toolkit one at a time!
    - **Use ensembles** to get the most out of what you know.

## Problem Solving Workflow
Big Data platforms are contested resources that cost Big $. Don't go Big prematurely.

![](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/data-science.png)

Hadoop is out of shot on the right.

## Problem Solving Workflow

1. Create solution on managable data sample using scripting language (Your practicals)
    - Prove performance is acceptable and solution is satisfactor answer to problem.
2. Scale up solution to smallest possible scale to run effectively of the life of the analysis. E.g:
    - Implement in C++ to run really fast on a meaty server.
    - Implement in Spark to run over Hadoop on a cluster.
3. **Automate EVERYTHING** and Abstract useful parts for your next Big Data **pipeline**.

## Pitfalls
* A solution that is 95% complete could be as good as 0% if you're out of money and time. 
    - Leave adequate time for scaling up, integration, and testing.
* Avoid the INFINITE MODEL SPACE - A black hole that crushes keen analysts.
    - Characterised by a combinatorial explosion of modelling options.
    - "Maybe we should just try method X to see what happens".
    - Stick to methods you understand. Work on samples.
    - Keep records of every model you fit and the results that you got. Seriously.
    
##Other things to know and love
* [Github](https://github.com/): It's the instagram for opensource software nerds. Get on it.
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): It's the future of open source and open sceince. Just use it.
